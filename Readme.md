This is a CRUD application written in Java (using Spring Boot 
for the controller class, service, entity and repository classes 
are written in plain Java) and mysql as database.
In order to run the application you need to have at least jdk 11 
installed as well as xampp. Clone the repository, import the 
boxes.sql 
file from the folder and open it in your preferred IDE. 
Alternatively if you want to run the application from the command 
line you should have maven installed 
(https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). Then use the commands `mvn install` and then `mvn spring-boot:run`.
